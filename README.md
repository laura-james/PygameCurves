#My attempt at a space invaders game
1. Use an image for a movable sprite - the gun
2. Create bullets that appear when you shoot (class of bullets?)
3. Use a sprite for an alien
4. Make Alien a class and create an array/lits of aliens with methods for shoot/die etc
5. Implement scoring when you hit an alien
6. Implement live when you get hit 3 times by alien
